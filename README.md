# CS256_project_code

This is the complete code for solving sudoku using Hopfield Neural network as well as A* search algorithm.
I have written the code for Hopfield Neural network and the A* search code is written by my project partner William.
Download and execute to run.

P.S. Extra files such as .kb and .rb are files related to PyKE rulebase. For that code to run , you should have PyKE rule engine installed.
